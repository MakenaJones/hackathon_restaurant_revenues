This project is based on the following Kaggle competition: [Restaurant Revenue Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction).

In this project, we try to predict the revenue of various restaurants using a number of features.  However, we are only given 137 data points to split into training / test data sets.  We conclude that with such a small amount of data, it is difficult to build any model that we can be *confident* will perform better than the null model on unseen data.
